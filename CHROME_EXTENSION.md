# Chrome Extension - LinkedIn Job Capture

This Chrome extension allows you to quickly capture job opportunities from LinkedIn and save them to your Job Application Tracker.

## Features

- **One-click capture**: Extract job details from LinkedIn job postings automatically
- **Editable form**: Review and edit captured data before saving
- **Sync with web app**: Automatically syncs with the web application when open
- **Offline storage**: Uses Chrome's storage API for reliable data persistence

## Installation

### Development Build

1. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build:extension
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)

4. Click "Load unpacked"

5. Select the `chrome-extension/dist` directory

6. The extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Adding Icons

The extension requires icons for proper display. Create or add the following icon files to `chrome-extension/`:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons. The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.

## Usage

### Capturing a Job Opportunity

1. Navigate to a LinkedIn job posting (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/...`)

2. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar

3. The popup will automatically extract:
   - Job title/position
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Job type (Remote/Hybrid/On-site)
   - Description
   - Salary (if available)
   - Posted date

4. Review and edit the captured data as needed

5. Click "Save to Opportunities" to save the job opportunity

6. The opportunity will appear in the "Opportunities" page of your web application

### Converting to Application

1. Open the Job Application Tracker web app

2. Navigate to the "Opportunities" page (click the "Opportunities" button in the header)

3. Review your saved opportunities

4. Click "Apply" on any opportunity to convert it to a job application

5. The opportunity will be moved to your applications list with status "Applied"

## Architecture

### Files Structure

```
chrome-extension/
├── manifest.json          # Extension manifest (Chrome extension config)
├── popup.html             # HTML container for the popup UI
├── popup.tsx              # React component for the popup form
├── content.ts             # Content script that runs on LinkedIn pages
├── background.ts          # Background service worker
└── dist/                  # Built files (generated by build:extension)
    ├── popup.js
    ├── content.js
    ├── background.js
    ├── manifest.json
    └── popup.html
```

### Components

#### Content Script (`content.ts`)
- Runs on LinkedIn job posting pages
- Extracts job data from the DOM using CSS selectors
- Responds to messages from the popup
- Syncs data with the web app via `postMessage`

#### Popup (`popup.tsx`)
- React-based UI for reviewing and editing captured data
- Communicates with content script to get job data
- Saves opportunities to `chrome.storage.local`
- Provides button to open the web application

#### Background Service Worker (`background.ts`)
- Handles extension lifecycle events
- Manages cross-tab communication
- Syncs data between extension and web app

### Data Flow

1. **Capture**: User opens popup on LinkedIn job page
   - Popup requests data from content script
   - Content script extracts data from DOM
   - Data sent back to popup

2. **Save**: User clicks "Save to Opportunities"
   - Data saved to `chrome.storage.local`
   - Background script attempts to sync with web app
   - Web app receives data via `postMessage` or `localStorage` events

3. **Sync**: Web app receives new opportunity
   - Listener in `HomePage` detects new opportunity
   - Shows success notification
   - Header badge updates automatically

## Development

### Building

```bash
npm run build:extension
```

This will:
1. Compile TypeScript files (popup.tsx, content.ts, background.ts)
2. Bundle React components and dependencies
3. Copy manifest.json and popup.html to dist/
4. Copy icon files if they exist

### Testing

1. Build the extension
2. Load it in Chrome as described in Installation
3. Navigate to a LinkedIn job posting
4. Test the capture and save functionality
5. Verify sync with the web app

### Debugging

- **Popup**: Right-click extension icon → "Inspect popup"
- **Content Script**: Open DevTools on LinkedIn page → Check Console
- **Background**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` → Click "service worker" link

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **storage**: To save opportunities in Chrome's storage
- **activeTab**: To access the current tab's URL and content
- **scripting**: To inject content scripts on LinkedIn pages
- **host_permissions**: Access to `linkedin.com` for content script injection

## Limitations

1. **LinkedIn Selectors**: The extension relies on LinkedIn's DOM structure. If LinkedIn changes their HTML structure, the selectors may need to be updated.

2. **Cross-Origin Storage**: The extension uses `chrome.storage.local` which is separate from the web app's `localStorage`. Sync happens via `postMessage` or manual refresh.

3. **SPA Navigation**: LinkedIn uses single-page application (SPA) navigation. The content script includes a mutation observer to detect page changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Popup shows "Loading job data..." indefinitely
- Make sure you're on a LinkedIn job posting page (`/jobs/view/...`)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page and opening the popup again

### Data not syncing with web app
- Make sure the web app is open in a browser tab
- Check that both extension and web app are using the same origin (localhost)
- Try manually refreshing the Opportunities page

### Extension icon not appearing
- Check that icons are in `chrome-extension/dist/` after build
- Verify manifest.json references the correct icon paths
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for other job boards (Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.)
- [ ] Batch capture (save multiple jobs at once)
- [ ] Direct application from extension
- [ ] Custom field mapping
- [ ] Export/import opportunities
- [ ] Notification when new opportunities are captured
